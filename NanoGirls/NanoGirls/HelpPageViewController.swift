This app is fun and allows children to learn about nanoscience while engaging in a game which allows them to become involved in real world environmental problems such as oil spills, earthquakes, bacterial and viral infections. \nThe games starts off with a background story of Nano-Gold and Nano-Silver. After the origin story the student will move on to the first level. In each level there is a short lesson at the beginning taught by either Nano-Gold or Nano-Silver. In the lesson the student will learn about a problem that one of the superheroes is having. After the lesson the student will play a mini game to collect or gain enough nanoparticles to help out the superheroes. Once the student has earned enough nanoparticles they will move on to the review question. If the student answers the review question correctly they will move on to the next level. If they answer incorrectly they will go back to the beginning of that level and restart. \nEach teacher will have a login account. Under the teachers login account there will be student accounts with usernames. The student will use the teachers login account information to gain access to their account. Each students account will save their place in the game for next time. The teacher will be able to see how much of the game the student has completed. \n \nHow to create a new login account. \n \nHow to create a new student ID. \n \nHow to start a new game."
